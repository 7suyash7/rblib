**rblib** is a high-performance, modular Rust SDK for constructing Ethereum-compatible block builders. Built on top of the [Reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth) execution engine, it provides robust, platform-agnostic primitives and declarative workflows designed for both L1 and L2 applications.

-----

## Core Philosophy

`rblib` is designed for sophisticated engineering teams who require granular control and composability in their block-building logic. Our philosophy centers on three key principles:

  * **Modularity:** Core components are decoupled. Use the low-level Payload API for fine-grained control, or compose high-level Pipelines for declarative workflows.
  * **Performance:** By leveraging Reth and a zero-copy design for payload state, `rblib` is built for high-throughput, latency-sensitive environments.
  * **Extensibility:** A clean `Platform` trait abstraction allows for seamless extension to support custom EVM-based chains (L2s, app-chains) without forking the core logic.

-----

## Key Features

  * **Composable Payload API:** A flexible, low-level API for constructing and inspecting block payloads via immutable `Checkpoint` transformations.
  * **Declarative Pipelines API:** A high-level, composable system for defining block-building workflows (e.g., ordering, revert protection) as reusable `Step`s.
  * **Platform-Agnostic Design:** Out-of-the-box support for `Ethereum` and `Optimism`, with a clear interface for adding new platforms.
  * **Integrated Testing Framework:** A rich test suite with utilities for multi-platform testing, local Reth nodes, and isolated component tests.

## Getting Started

Add `rblib` to your project's dependencies:

```bash
cargo add rblib
```

-----

## Core Concepts

`rblib` is split into two primary APIs that can be used independently or together.

### 1\. The Payload API

Located in `rblib::payload` (see `src/payload`), this API provides the foundational primitives for block construction. It enables exploring many different payload variations efficiently.

#### Checkpoints

A `Checkpoint<P>` is an immutable snapshot of a payload's state after a mutation (e.g., applying a transaction or bundle). Checkpoints are cheap to clone and fork, making it trivial to explore alternative block constructions from a common state. Each checkpoint retains the history of its parent, allowing it to act as a `DatabaseRef` for the chain state at that specific point. Common algorithms for inspecting checkpoints are available in `src/payload/ext/checkpoint.rs`.

**Example: Building and Forking a Payload**

```rust
use rblib::{*, test_utils::*};

let ctx = BlockContext::<Ethereum>::mocked();

// Create a linear history
let checkpoint1 = ctx.apply(tx1)?;
let checkpoint2 = checkpoint1.apply(tx2)?;

// Fork from an earlier state to explore an alternative
let checkpoint3_alt = checkpoint1.apply(tx3)?;

// Compare the outcomes of the two different forks
let gas_main = checkpoint2.cumulative_gas_used();
let gas_alt = checkpoint3_alt.cumulative_gas_used();
let balance_main = checkpoint2.balance_of(coinbase_addr);
let balance_alt = checkpoint3_alt.balance_of(coinbase_addr);
```

#### Spans

A `Span<P>` is a view over a linear sequence of checkpoints, useful for analyzing or manipulating a specific portion of a payload's history.

```rust
use rblib::payload::*;

let full_history = checkpoint.history();
let total_gas = full_history.gas_used();

// Analyze a sub-section of the payload
let sub_span = full_history.skip(2).take(4);
let sub_gas = sub_span.gas_used();
```

### 2\. The Pipelines API

Located in `rblib::pipelines` (see `src/pipelines/`), this API uses the Payload API to create declarative, reusable block-building workflows. It is particularly powerful for L2s, where standardized logic can be composed and customized.

Pipelines are built from **Steps** (`src/pipelines/step.rs`) and control-flow components (`src/pipelines/mod.rs`). A rich library of common, reusable steps is provided in `src/pipelines/steps/`.

**Example: A Minimal Builder Pipeline**

This example defines a pipeline that loops over a set of ordering and protection steps before finalizing the block.

```rust
use rblib::*;

fn main() {
    // Define a reusable pipeline workflow
    let pipeline = Pipeline::<Ethereum>::default()
        .with_epilogue(BuilderEpilogue)
        .with_pipeline(
            Loop,
            (
                AppendOneOrder::default(),
                PriorityFeeOrdering,
                TotalProfitOrdering,
                RevertProtection,
            ),
        );

    // Integrate with a Reth node
    Cli::parse_args()
        .run(|builder, _| async move {
            let handle = builder
                .with_types::<EthereumNode>()
                .with_components(
                    EthereumNode::components()
                        .payload(pipeline.into_service()))
                .with_add_ons(EthereumAddOns::default())
                .launch()
                .await?;

            handle.wait_for_node_exit().await
        })
        .unwrap();
}
```

-----

## Platform Abstraction

Chain-specific logic (e.g., transaction types, block validation rules) is abstracted via the `Platform` trait (`src/platform/mod.rs`). This allows the core building logic to remain generic while providing concrete implementations for `Ethereum` and `Optimism`.

To support a custom chain, implement the `Platform` trait. See `examples/custom-platform.rs` for a practical example.

-----

## Examples and Integration

`Pipeline::into_service()` is the primary entry point for converting a pipeline into a Reth-compatible `PayloadServiceBuilder`. For complete integration examples, see the `examples/` directory and the reference builder implementation in `bin/flashblocks/src/main.rs`.

-----

## Development & Testing

The project includes a comprehensive testing infrastructure to ensure reliability.

  * **Run all tests:**
    ```bash
    cargo test
    ```
  * **Run a specific test with verbose logging:**
    ```bash
    TEST_TRACE=on cargo test smoke::all_transactions_included_ethereum
    ```
- **Multi-Platform Testing**: Use `#[rblib_test(Ethereum, Optimism, YourCustomPlatform)]` to run tests across platforms.
- **Local Test Nodes**: `LocalNode<P, C>` (`src/test_utils/node.rs`) provides full Reth nodes for integration testing.
- **Step Testing**: `OneStep<P>` (`src/test_utils/step.rs`) enables isolated step testing.
- **Funded Accounts**: Use `FundedAccounts::by_address()` or `.with_random_funded_signer()` for test transactions.
- **Mocks**: Mocking utilities are available for types like `BlockContext` and `PayloadAttributes`.
