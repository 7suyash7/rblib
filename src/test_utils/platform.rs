/// for their own custom platforms.
///
/// Example usage:
///
/// Create ethereum test node:
/// ```rust
/// let pipeline = Pipeline::default();
/// let node = Ethereum::create_test_node(pipeline).await?;
/// ```
///
/// Create optimism test node:
/// ```rust
/// let pipeline = Pipeline::default();
/// let node = Optimism::create_test_node(pipeline).await?;
/// ```
///
/// Generic instantiation:
/// ```rust
/// use crate::test_utils::TestablePlatform;
/// fn run_test<T: TestablePlatform>() -> eyre::Result<()> {
/// 	let pipeline = Pipeline::default();
/// 	let node = T::create_test_node(pipeline).await?;
/// 	Ok(())
/// }
