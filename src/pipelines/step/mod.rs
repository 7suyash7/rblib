/// This trait defines a step in a pipeline.
///
/// Users of the SDK should implement this trait on their own types to make them
/// usable in a pipeline. A step is a unit of work that can be executed
/// independently and can be composed with other steps in a pipeline.
///
/// Steps receive a `Checkpoint` as an input, which is the state of the payload
/// that has been built so far. The step can then modify this payload, add new
/// transactions, or perform any other operations that are needed to build the
/// final payload. The output of a step is a `ControlFlow` enum that carries a
/// new version of the payload or an error that will terminate the pipeline.
///
/// The `Step` trait is generic over the `Platform` type, which allows it to
/// be used with different platforms (e.g., Ethereum, Optimism, etc.). Steps
/// can be generic over the platform they run on or specialized for a specific
/// platform.
///
/// The instance of the step is long-lived and it's lifetime is equal to the
/// lifetime of the pipeline it is part of. All invocations of the step will
/// repeatedly call into the `step` async function on the same instance.
///
/// There may be multiple instances of the same step in a pipeline.
///
/// A step instance is guaranteed to not be called concurrently by the runtime.
