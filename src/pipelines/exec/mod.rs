//! Pipeline execution
//!
//! A pipeline is a declarative description of the steps that need to be
//! executed to arrive at a desired payload or signal the inability to do so.
//!
//! The pipeline definition itself does not have any logic for executing
//! steps, enforcing limits or nested pipelines. This is done by the execution
//! engine.
//!
//! Before running the pipeline, the payload will have the platform-specific
//! [`BlockBuilder::apply_pre_execution_changes`] applied to its state.
